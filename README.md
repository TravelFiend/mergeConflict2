# mergeConflict2

kasdfj Just to have something to save.

Bob and Alice definitely should have updated their local master branches after the first merge. Then, they should have made a new branch off of that updated code base instead of continuing to work on their old, outdated code. Boo, naughty. Ted and Alice should have both updated their code bases, and even though Ted had, he should have branched off of master instead of working on a new feature on the same branch as before.
