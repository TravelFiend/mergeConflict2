# mergeConflict2

Joel's reflection
It seems the biggest git sin is not pulling from that sweet sweet fresh master file.
If only they had pull from master before creating new a new branch then all would be fine and happy in the world.

I thouhgt it was really cool that when I was bob, after I made a pull request with conflicts, pulled the master, and then pushed again, github recognized in my current pull request that it was updated and was now new and clean and sparkly!

ps.
I still hate git.

Love Joel
