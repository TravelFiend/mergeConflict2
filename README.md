# mergeConflict2

Bob and Carol didn't pull from master before creating and working on their new branch.  This meant that when Ted and Alice tried to erge their feature, all team members got merge conflicts.  To prevent this, they should have pulled from master to new branches before working on, and trying to push, their new work.  What a hot mess!
